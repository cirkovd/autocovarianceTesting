  Abstract                 = {Policy prescriptions have generally assumed that exchange rate depreciation would stimulate exports and curtail imports, while exchange rate appreciation would be detrimental to exports and encourage imports. This prediction has, however, often neglected to consider the existence of the import content of exports, as well as the dynamic effects of productivity improvements. Our paper seeks to show empirically, the significance of these two factors in affecting the competitiveness of Singapore's exports. Specifically, the paper shows that in the presence of high import content, exports are not adversely affected by currency appreciation because the lower import prices due to appreciation reduce the cost of export production. In the case of Singapore, this cushioning effect outweighs that of the effect of productivity gains on export competitiveness. The service exports, however, with a very low import content tend to suffer from currency appreciation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the empirical validity of a simple monetary model of exchange rate determination. The model stresses that the exchange rate, which is the relative price of two monies, is determined by the relative supplies of, and demands for, the two monies, rather than by the condition for flow equilibrium in the balance of payments. It follows from this approach that the exchange rate is determined by the relative money supplies, the levels of real income, and the nominal interest rates in the two countries under consideration. The monetary model provides a useful tool for exchange rate analysis because it (a) clearly defines the role of speculation among the determinants of the exchange rate; (b) provides a workable definition of the equilibrium exchange rate; and (c) directly relates the equilibrium rate to the underlying instruments of monetary policy. The model is tested using data on the Deutsche mark/pound rate during the current floating rate period. This particular rate was chosen because of the large variance in the variable stressed by the monetary approach. The empirical tests broadly support this approach, although the need for a more complete empirical model is evident.},

  Abstract                 = {A typical finding in the empirical literature is that import and export demand elasticities are rather low, and that the Marshall--Lerner (ML) condition does not hold. However, despite the evidence against the ML condition, the consensus is that real devaluations do improve the balance of trade, though after a lag because of J-curve effects. The aim of this paper is to try and measure the effects of the real exchange rate on the balance of payments using structural cointegrating vector autoregressive distributed lag (VARDL) models for domestic and foreign output, the balance of trade and the real exchange rate. Small systems are estimated for eight OECD countries to investigate long-run cointegration. Generalized impulse response functions are calculated to investigate the response to shocks. These show evidence of J-effects. The VARDL estimates suggest a single cointegrating vector and that output and the real exchange rate can be treated as weakly exogenous for the parameters of the balance of payment equation. This allows estimation using a single-equation ARDL. Although there is considerable heterogeneity, overall the results suggest that the ML condition is satisfied in the long run.},

In particular, desired marginal posterior densities are obtained utilizing the Gibbs sampler, an iterative Monte Carlo method. This approach avoids sophisticated analytic and numerical high dimensional integration procedures. We include an application to changing regressions, changing Poisson processes and changing Markov chains. Within these contexts we handle several previously inaccessible problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a positive theory of credibility, ambiguity, and inflation under discretion and asymmetric information. The monetary policymaker maximizes his own (politically motivated) objective function that is positively related to economic stimulation through monetary suprises and negatively related to monetary growth. The relative importance he assigns to each target shifts stochastically through time. His current preference trade-off is known to him but not to the public. When choosing the (state contingent) path of money growth for the present and the future, the policy aker compares the benefits from current stimulation with the costs associated with higher future inflation expectations. Current monetary growth conveys information to the public about future money growth because there is persistence in the policymaker's objectives. Although expectations are rational, information is imperfect because monetary control procedures are imprecise. As a result the public cannot correctly distinguish persistent changes of emphasis on different policy objectives from transitory monetary control errors. The public becomes aware of changes gradually by observing past monetary growth. Credibility is defined in terms of the speed with which the public recognizes changes in the objectives of the policymaker. Credibility is lower the noisier monetary control and the more stable the objectives of the policymaker. Looser monetary control and a higher degree of time preference on the part of the policymaker induce him to produce higher and more variable monetary growth. When the policymaker is free to determine the accuracy of monetary control he does not always choose the most effective control available in spite of the fact that monetary surprises always have an expected value of zero. The reason is that ambiguous control procedures enable the policymaker to generate positive surprises when he cares more than on average about economic stimulation. He leaves the inevitable negative surprises for periods in which he cares more about inflation prevention. This result provides an explanation for the Fed's preference for ambiguity, recently documented by Goodfriend (1986). The policymaker is more likely to pick more ambiguous control procedures the more uncertain his objectives and the higher his time preference. The paper also provides a theoretical underpinning for the well documented cross-country positive correlation between the level and the variability of inflation.},

We show that non-degenerate limit laws exist for M-estimates if the loss function is sufficiently smooth; these results remain valid if location and scale are also estimated. For least absolute deviation (LAD) estimates, similar results hold under conditions on the innovations distribution near 0. We also discuss, under moment conditions on the innovations, consistency properties for M-estimators corresponding to the class of loss functions, ϱ(x) = |x |γ for some γ &gt; 0. },

  Abstract                 = {In the past several decades, professional views on the relation between inflation and unemployment have gone through two stages and are now entering a third. The first was the acceptance of a stable trade-off (a stable Phillips curve). The second was the introduction of inflation expectations, as a variable shifting the short-run Phillips curve, and of the natural rate of unemployment, as determining the location of a vertical long-run Phillips curve. The third is occasioned by the empirical phenomenon of an apparent positive relation between inflation and unemployment. The paper explores the possibility that this relation may be more than coincidental.},

  Abstract                 = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider an L1 analogue of the least squares estimator for the parameters of stationary, finite-order autoregressions. This estimator, the least absolute deviation (LAD), is shown to be strongly consistent via a result that may have independent interest. The striking feature is that the conditions are so mild as to include processes with infinite variance, notably the stationary, finite autoregressions driven by stable increments in Lα. Finally, sampling properties of LAD are compared to those of least squares. Together with a known convergence rate result for least squares, the Monte Carlo study provides evidence for a conjecture on the convergence rate of LAD.},

The evidence indicates that the expansionary and contractionary effects cancel out in determining industrial real output growth in the face of exchange rate fluctuations. More importantly, there is evidence of a reduction in price inflation in several industries, which is statistically significant in Finance, in response to dollar appreciation. This evidence is consistent with the reduction in aggregate demand through the decline in net exports and the increase in aggregate supply through the reduction in the cost of imported intermediate goods.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers adaptive estimation in nonstationary autoregressive moving average models with the noise sequence satisfying a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic process. The locally asymptotic quadratic form of the log-likelihood ratio for the model is obtained. It is shown that the limit experiment is neither LAN nor LAMN, but is instead LABF. For the model with symmetric density of the rescaled error, a new efficiency criterion is established for a class of defined Mν-estimators. It is shown that such efficient estimators can be constructed when the density is known. Using the kernel estimator for the score function, adaptive estimators are constructed when the density of the rescaled error is symmetric, and it is shown that the adaptive procedure for the parameters in the conditional mean part uses the full sample without splitting. These estimators are demonstrated to be asymptotically efficient in the class of Mν-estimators. The paper includes the results that the stationary ARMA-GARCH model is LAN, and that the parameters in the model with symmetric density of the rescaled error are adaptively estimable after a reparameterization of the GARCH process. This paper also establishes the locally asymptotic quadratic form of the log-likelihood ratio for nonlinear time series models with ARCH-type errors.},

  Abstract                 = {Mundell-Fleming model of open economy macroeconomics has amply established that the nature and direction of causal relationship between money supply and exchange rate depend on the exchange rate regimes. Particularly bidirectional causal relation between domestic money supply and exchange rate is the common phenomenon in the pegged regime of exchange rate, while unidirectional causality running from money supply to exchange rate is the feature of the market determination regime. This study is devoted to enquire into these issues in the context of Indian exchange rate regimes. Using quarterly time series data of the variables concerned, the study bears the evidence that under the basket peg and market determination exchange rate regimes money supply and rupee/dollar exchange rate in India are cointegrated. In the era of basket peg, bidirectional Granger causality is established, while in the era of market determined regime, unidirectional Granger causality running from money supply to exchange rate has been testified.},

In certain circumstances, such as regression models with independent and identically distributed error terms, appropriately chosen bootstrap methods generally work very well. However, there are many other cases, such as regression models with dependent errors, in which bootstrap methods do not always work well. This paper discusses a large number of bootstrap methods that can be useful in econometrics. Applications to hypothesis testing are emphasized, and simulation results are presented for a few illustrative cases.},
